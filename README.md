# What I Did
Added authentication to the website, after enough struggling and help from TAs. The lab was deceptively lengthy. It seemed at the beginning to be more like a short assignment, with most of the code provided. There was a lot provided, but there was also a lot to write and understand.

# What Worked/What Didn't
It was, at times, incredibly difficult to understand what the issues were with authentication. There were a ton of files and a lot of tracing involved, and it's going to take a lot more practice with authentication before I actually start to feel comfortable with it. For example, getting the username to work involved figuring out why the author field was undefined, which had to be traced back through multiple files until I realized the author object was being returned as a string object that looked like JSON (and I'm still not exactly sure why that was happening).

# Extra Credit
None. Sorry to disappoint again. :sob:
